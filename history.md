# Major Project History File
Will write a short summary of each meaningful update made to the game here, along with version number

## Update 0.1 - 30/4/2019
Focused on having 2D Array based material for submission for the related class assignment
- Added a memory puzzle mini-game where players can win cookies by remembering 8 pairs of cards
- Added a rhythm mini-game where players use the buttons 1, 2, 3, 4 on the keyboard to play a short song and earn cookies
- Both utilize and manipulate 2D arrays in some way
- Backbone for a significantly more efficient window manager
