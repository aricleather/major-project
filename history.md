# Major Project History File
Will write a short summary of each meaningful update made to the game here, along with version number

## Update 0.1 - 30/4/2019
Focused on having 2D Array based material for submission for the related class assignment
- Added a memory puzzle mini-game where players can win cookies by remembering 8 pairs of cards
- Added a rhythm mini-game where players use the buttons 1, 2, 3, 4 on the keyboard to play a short song and earn cookies
- Both utilize and manipulate 2D arrays in some way
- Backbone for a significantly more efficient window manager
- Better resizing on some elements of the game

## Update 0.2 - 13/5/2019
- Upgraded window manager is complete and incorporated with all other game elements
- Also began work on reworking the new text box class, in order to redo the game intro with a more efficient system

## Update 0.2.5 - 16/5/2019
- Text box system is done and intro is remade
- Now working on adding animations and battles

## Update 0.3 - 23/5/2019
- Battle menu is complete
- Ready to start programming in the tower defense game mode

## Update 0.3 - 3/6/2019
- The tower defense mode is now slightly interactive.
- The UI is complete and the start round button is ready for whatever it will do

## Update 0.3.5 - 11/6/2019
- Towers in the tower defense game mode can now target and shoot at enemies with projectiles

## Update 0.3.5 - 14/6/2019
- Mobile mode successfully implemented
- Code detects if user is on mobile and displays a dumbed down but appealing and functional version of the cookie clicker game if so

## Update 0.4 - 17/6/2019
- This is the project I am going to hand in. There is now a help button with a basic intro in the main menu screen and,
  even though each sub-goal was not necessarily met in my need to haves, the large, over-arching concepts of what needed
  to be done have all been achieved at this point.

## BETA TESTING LOG, from June 15, 2019
### Comments from Alex:
- Generally easy to figure out what to do but could do with some help options
- Understand that its because the game is incomplete but the fact that the weapons do nothing seems kind of odd
- Bit harder to figure out what to do in the battle mode

### Comments from David:
- Have played a ton of clicker games figured out what to do right away
- The battle mode also seemed intuitive, says that is because it is based off of Bloons

### Comments from Ehsan:
- Don't really like clicker games but figuring out what to do isn't hard
- Should add some sort of help dialog
